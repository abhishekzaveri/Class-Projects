All parts of our assignment work.

We chose this implementation for our for loop because it is a crucial part of
coding to be able to implement what a for loop implements, and it directly
follows the format for C code for a for loop. 

We have included two test files that show that the iteration works properly. 


program ::= block
block ::= declaration_list statement_list
declaration_list ::= {declaration}
statement_list ::= {statement}
declaration ::= ’@’ id { ’,’ id }
statement ::= assignment | print | do | if | for
print ::= ’!’ expr
assignment ::= ref_id ’=’ expr
ref_id ::= [ ’˜’ [ number ] ] id
do ::= ’<’ guarded_command ’>’
if ::= ’[’ guarded_command { ’|’ guarded_command } [ ’%’ block ] ’]’
for ::= '$' declaration assignment expr assignment block &

guarded_command ::= expr ’:’ block
expr ::= term { addop term }
term ::= factor { multop factor }

factor ::= ’(’ expr ’)’ | ref_id | number
addop ::= ’+’ | ’-’
multop ::= ’*’ | ’/’
